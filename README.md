## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

This time, I decided to extract the data from the given HTML file, and store it in a JavaScript object instead, because it made it easier to handle the states, and the code turned out to be cleaner overall.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass, CSS Modules
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
